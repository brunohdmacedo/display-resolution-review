# Display Resolutions Review
I just want to just share my personal 
experience from using different resolutions 
from different desktops. 

Before the pandemic, I was satisfied with
my HP Stream netbook. That is just
too low in specs and too small screen. 
But during the pandemic,
we were forced to do online classes
and all work is done through the computer.

First, I simply project the netbook
to an external monitor 24" 1080p. Then, 
we were provided by our company
with iMac 21.5 inches, 
that's 4k Retina Display, 
knowing that we really need that.
Plus there are two extra external 
monitor, 19.5 inches, 1080p and
a smart TV 42 inches 1080p.
