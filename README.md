# Display Resolution Review
I just want to just share my personal 
experience from using different resolutions 
from different desktops. 

Before the pandemic, I was satisfied with
my HP Stream netbook. That is just
too low in specs and the screen is,
of course, too small screen. 
But nowadays, during the pandemic,
we are forced to do online classes
and all work is done through the computer.
So, this one really matters now.

First, I simply project the netbook
to an external monitor 24" 1080p. Then, 
we were provided by our company
with iMac 21.5 inches, 
that's 4k Retina Display, 
knowing that we really need that.
Plus there are two extra external 
monitor, 19.5 inches, 1080p and
a smart TV 42 inches 1080p.

With these too many screens, I realized
these things:

## 24-Inch 1080p
If that is really 1080p, then, that's good.
You have a lot of space. With Windows OS,
you get a scaled view of everything. They
say Windows OS is not good being scaled but
I think it's just fine. When you compare that
to MacBook Pro scaling, then it's not that
good.

But here is one thing you achieve: 
you have bigger fonts especially when your
eyesight is poor.

Viewing distance is a litte bit further
since fonts are bigger. But still, it
is a good one. That's really good for poor
eyesight. 4k resolution actually does 
not answer that so even Mac can be scaled.

Also, some other external 24-Inch monitor
is already curved. This actually has no
benefit for this size.

## iMac 21.5-Inch 4k Retina Display
If you have 20/20 eyesight, then, 
you'll find this 4k Retina Display an 
awesome experience. There is only one
catch: make sure you have the correct
viewing distance.

I'm not mentioning any specific distance,
but the basic rule is that stretch your
arm then find the correct spot there
whether moving away or towards the monitor.
It was just I came from the larger
scaling of 1080p and Windows OS, I 
realized I should be closer for this 
display. And once I have my spot, 
the experience is actually good,
I don't experience much digital
eye strain.

And since they say, it's retina display
the individual pixels are too much, you
will not see any individual pixel, no matter
how close are you. 

This one really makes a striking difference:
when using GitHub and you are editing the
document right there at the site,
you'll see that even the fonts are too
small in editing mode, they are not problematic,
of course, if you have a normal vision.
Compared to 1080p, it's a little bit bigger,
but you can see the individual pixels.

The 27-Inch iMac is still not curved,
in my experience also, this is really true.
But beyond this size, you need a curved one.

## The 42-Inch Smart TV
This external monitor is not a completely
computer monitor, no matter how they claim
it to be. They are more for viewing videos 
and hence cannot be used, say, for editing
text file. It can be but for sure, your eyes
will not be able to handle it for a longer
period. Even if they claim a 4k 50-Inch 
screen, as evidence of the price it is sold,
computer monitors tend to be expensive.
