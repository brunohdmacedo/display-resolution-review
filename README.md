# Display Resolutions Review
I just want to just share my personal 
experience from using different resolutions 
from different desktops. 

Before the pandemic, I was satisfied with
my HP Stream netbook. That is just
too low in specs and too small screen. 
But during the pandemic,
we were forced to do online classes
and all work is done through the computer.

First, I simply project the netbook
to an external monitor 24" 1080p. Then, 
we were provided by our company
with iMac 21.5 inches, 
that's 4k Retina Display, 
knowing that we really need that.
Plus there are two extra external 
monitor, 19.5 inches, 1080p and
a smart TV 42 inches 1080p.

With these too many screens, I realized
these things:

## 24-Inch 1080p
If that is really 1080p, then, that's good.
You have a lot of space. With Windows OS,
you get a scaled view of everything. They
say Windows OS is not good being scaled but
I think it's just fine. When you compare that
to MacBook Pro scaling, then it's not that
good.

But here is one thing you achieve: 
you have bigger fonts especially when your
eyesight is poor.

Viewing distance is a litte bit further
since fonts are bigger. But still, it
is a good one. That's really good for poor
eyesight. 4k resolution actually does 
not answer that so even Mac can be scaled.

## iMac 21.5-Inch 4k Retina Display
If you have 20/20 eyesight, then, 
you'll find this 4k Retina Display an 
awesome experience. There is only one
catch: make sure you have the correct
viewing distance.

I'm not mentioning any specific distance,
but the basic rule is that stretch your
arm then find the correct spot there
whether moving away or to the monitor.
