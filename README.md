# Display Resolution Review
I just want to just share my personal 
experience from using different resolutions 
from different desktops. 

Before the pandemic, I was satisfied with
my HP Stream netbook. That is just
too low in specs and the screen is,
of course, too small. 
But nowadays, during the pandemic,
we are forced to do online classes
and all work is done through the computer.
So, this one really matters now.

First, I simply project the netbook
to an external monitor 24" 1080p. Then, 
we were provided by our company
with the iMac 21.5", 
that's 4k Retina Display, 
knowing that we really need that.
Plus, there are two external 
monitors, 19.5" 1080p and
a smart TV 42" 1080p.

With these too many screens, I realized
these things (for productivity):

## 24-Inch 1080p
If that is really 1080p, then, that's good.
You have a lot of space. With Windows OS,
you get a scaled view of everything. They
say Windows OS is not good at being scaled but
I think it's just fine. When you compare that
to MacBook Pro scaling, then it's not that
good.

But here is one thing you achieve: 
you have bigger projection of everything,
especially when your eyesight is poor.

Viewing distance is a little bit farther
since the projection is bigger. But still, it
is a good one. That's really good for poor
eyesight. 4k resolution actually is not so
good for poor eyesight so that Mac 
still has the option to 
lower the resolution.

Also, some other external 24-Inch monitor
is already curved. This actually has no
benefit for this size.
The 27-Inch iMac is still not curved.
But beyond this size, you need a curved one.

## iMac 21.5-Inch 4k Retina Display
If you have 20/20 eyesight, then, 
you'll find this 4k Retina Display an 
awesome experience. There is only one
catch: make sure you have the correct
viewing distance.

I'm not mentioning any specific distance,
but the basic rule is that you stretch your
arm then find the correct spot there
whether moving away or towards the monitor.
It was just I came from the larger
scaling of 1080p and Windows OS, I 
realized I should be closer for this 
display. And once I have my spot, 
the experience is actually good,
I don't experience much digital
eye strain.

And since they say it's retina display
the individual pixels are too much, you
will not see any individual pixel, no matter
how close you are.
This one really makes a 
striking difference, for example,
when using GitHub and you are editing the
document right there at the site,
you'll see that even the fonts are too
small in editing mode, they are not problematic
if you have a normal vision.
Compared to 1080p, the 1080p is 
a little bit bigger,
but you can see the individual pixels.
In my experience, 
I can say it's not as dense compared to
the Retina Display of iMac. That really
matters.

## The 42-Inch Smart TV
This external monitor is not completely
a computer monitor, no matter how it is claimed
to be. Also, it's not just the 42-Inch.
These displays are more for viewing videos 
and hence cannot be used, say, for
text editing. It can be, but for sure, your eyes
will not be able to handle it for a longer
period. Even if they claim a 4k 50-Inch 
screen, computer monitors tend to be more expensive,
so from the price alone, you can say it's not
really a good quality even if manufacturers
insist it's 4k resolution.

This 42-Inch Smart TV is projecting the 
iMac, but still is not good quality
for productivity. Again, let me emphasize
**for productivity**. It's
good for viewing because you have a very
large projection. So, you can use larger
TV screens for viewing videos in YouTube
while you are working, say, playing a 
music video or live concert. 
You just saved money for a larger projection
of videos. That's an awesome 
experience too, again, for 
viewing videos.

Even if say, it's purely 4k like the iMac
screen, still you tend to watch videos 
farther so 4k at that point will not really
matter.
